## ESP32 Controller 

The latest version of the controller uses an ESP32 and supports CANBUS, RS485, SD CARD logging, relays, SSR outputs, multiple inputs, AVR programmer and much more.

Although the hardware is complete, not all features are usable from the software, this will be developed and improved over time to make use of the hardware.
