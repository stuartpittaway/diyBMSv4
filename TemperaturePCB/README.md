### KiCAD 7
This design uses KiCAD version 7.0.5.  Use the same or newer version for editing and viewing the files.  You don't need to install KiCAD if you just wish to build one.

### JLCPCB
This design will create a PCB and design files suitable for "almost" full construction at JLCPCB.  Some manual soldering will still be required for the connectors and cabling.

Look inside the "export" folder for the relevant production files.
