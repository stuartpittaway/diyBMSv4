# Hand Assembly Parts

These parts are not usually available for assembly by JLCPCB, so you need to order these from some where else and manually solder them to the modules

You will also need some JST cables to connect the controller and modules together.  

These have a FEMALE JST PH 2.0 2pin connector on them and are wired "straight through", that is, pin 1 goes to pin 1, 2 to 2.

You may be able to connect two of these cables together, take a look at Amazon
