# DIYBMS All-in-one 16S PASSIVE BALANCE BOARD

This is the hardware for the PASSIVE BALANCE BOARD add-on to the all in one monitoring solution.

**WARNING**: This hardware is considered experimental & prototype, use at your own risk - it may not work as intended or at all.

### KiCAD 7
This design uses KiCAD version 7.0.5.  Use the same or newer version for editing and viewing the files.  You don't need to install KiCAD if you just wish to build one.

### JLCPCB
This design will create a PCB and design files suitable for "almost" full construction at JLCPCB.  Some manual soldering will still be required for the connectors and cabling.

Look inside the "export" folder for the relevant production files.  You will need these files for the construction:

* module_16s_passive_gerbers.zip
* module_16s_passive_bom_jlc.csv
* module_16s_passive_cpl_jlc.csv

# FAN

The fan is 40x40mm, 12V.  The current must be less than 150mA (0.15A).

A suitable fan is this one...

You will need to replace the power connector with a 2 pin JST PH style plug.  Cut the yellow wire off, this is not used.
